# RPI4_NCS2
Raspberrry pi 4 OpenVINO Python

The Raspberry pi 4 is now out, and runs the latest version of Raspbian 10 Buster!
Currently if you follow the instruction at: https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_raspbian.html
to install OpenVino, although the builds complete sucessfully for the C++ programs shipped with it, the Python bindings fail.

The package supplied by Intel does not expect Python 3.7, or Rasbian Buster for that matter.
I imagine they will release an update at some point, but I am not very patient.
Here is a workaround, that can get you up and running with OpenVINO on the pi4! 
It appears to work well, at least with my scripts from the PI3. I am getting > 30FPS with the async script on a single NCS2!

That said, there may be things I have not taken into account, or even broken, that I am not aware of!


Initial setup:

Create a directiory in your home folder:

cd ~
mkdir openvino
cd openvino

Install cmake, if you want to build the shipped C++ examples:

sudo apt-get install cmake

Go and grab the lates openvino toolkit (This assumes you are still in ~openvino):

```
wget https://download.01.org/opencv/2019/openvinotoolkit/R3/l_openvino_toolkit_runtime_raspbian_p_2019.3.334.tgz
```

Untar:
```
tar -xf l_openvino_toolkit_raspbi_p_2019.1.094.tgz
```
REPLACE ~/openvino/inference_engine_vpu_arm/bin/setupvars.sh with the version of setupvars.sh that I have uploaded here:
https://github.com/leswright1977/RPI4_NCS2/blob/master/src/setupvars.sh 
About the file:
Fixed expected OS version
Hacked in some symlinks and dynamically loaded libs to fix errors. 

Enable the environment (note we force the script to believe we are running python 3.5)
```
source ~/openvino/inference_engine_vpu_arm/bin/setupvars.sh -pyver 3.5
```

Echo the following line into ~./bashrc so the env is loaded at logon:
```
echo "source ~/openvino/inference_engine_vpu_arm/bin/setupvars.sh -pyver 3.5" >> ~/.bashrc
```
Add the user 'pi' to the users group:
sudo usermod -a -G users pi

Run the following script:
```
sh ~/openvino/inference_engine_vpu_arm/install_dependencies/install_NCS_udev_rules.sh
```
Done!

*Note: if your scripts currently have an import line like this:
from openvino.inference_engine import IENetwork, IEPlugin

As of the latest version of openvino, this is now:
from armv7l.openvino.inference_engine import IENetwork, IEPlugin
